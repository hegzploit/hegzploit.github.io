I managed to solve the first challenge during the CTF, and solved the remaining two afterwards. Be sure to check out the official writeup by the author. As of writing this, I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the author&amp;rsquo;s writeup to avoid being influenced by the intended solutions. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through my methodology and approach for solving these three challenges.</description><dc:creator>Yusuf Hegazy</dc:creator><media:content url="https://hegzploit.github.ioimages/thumbnails/lbr.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware</category></item><item><title>Reactive Vault 1</title><link>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/reactive-vault-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>me@hegz.io (Yusuf Hegazy)</author><atom:modified>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/reactive-vault-1/</guid><description>I started by installing the APK on an android phone, once opened it will show a text field to enter a key and a login button, the APK will try to navigate to https://you-shall-not-pass when trying to type any key (maybe this was done to prevent bruteforcing the key?), finally, when you try to login with a random key It will show a dialog saying &amp;ldquo;BAAAD Key&amp;rdquo;

I had zero practical experience with AI prior and had only a minimal theoretical understanding of some concepts. While this work may not seem like much, this was a rough ride for me, and I can confidently say that it was worth it. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the opportunity to do this type of work otherwise, and I will probably not touch AI at this level anytime soon.</description><dc:creator>Yusuf Hegazy</dc:creator><media:content url="https://hegzploit.github.ioimages/thumbnails/gp.jpeg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>misc</category></item><item><title>Hacking the Hackathon: How We Optimized Our Way to Third Place</title><link>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/hacking-the-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>me@hegz.io (Yusuf Hegazy)</author><atom:modified>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/hacking-the-hackathon/</guid><description>Are you ready to put your coding skills to the ultimate test?

It depends on a lot of factors, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t boldly assume that logic works with everyone, a good strategy to get your message through might be analyzing the recipient, before deciding on your means of communication.
That&amp;rsquo;s a useful skill If you have to deal with multitude of different people, life is all about balancing things and overdoing is never wise.</description><dc:creator>Yusuf Hegazy</dc:creator><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Ways to return function values in C</title><link>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/passing-values-in-c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>me@hegz.io (Yusuf Hegazy)</author><atom:modified>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/passing-values-in-c/</guid><description>I was having a chit-chat with a friend discussing some C language shenanigans

Diophantus of Alexandria Diophantus was a Greek mathematician that flourished around 250 AD, he is most famous for his book &amp;ldquo;Arithmetica&amp;rdquo; in which he had compiled 130 algebraic problems among thirteen books where most of their solutions were positive integers, and that&amp;rsquo;s why mathematicians call such algebraic equations as &amp;ldquo;Diophantine Equations&amp;rdquo;.</description><dc:creator>Yusuf Hegazy</dc:creator><media:content url="https://hegzploit.github.ioimages/header/diophantus_header.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>math</category></item><item><title>Buffer Overflows for Newbies</title><link>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/bof-for-normies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 02:46:12 +0200</pubDate><author>me@hegz.io (Yusuf Hegazy)</author><atom:modified>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 02:46:12 +0200</atom:modified><guid>https://hegzploit.github.io/posts/bof-for-normies/</guid><description>What is a Buffer anyway? We can think of buffers as containers to hold our data for later use, it&amp;rsquo;s not really something specific to computer science; In fact, we have buffers in electronics, mechanics, chemistry and even politics!
We can say that the word buffer is just a fancy name for a placeholder (temporary storage)!

enough ranting, maybe this needs it&amp;rsquo;s own blog post after all or maybe not, it&amp;rsquo;s a highly controversial topic whatsoever.

Normal Recursion, A Factorial Example Most of us tech nerds have already dealt with the good &amp;lsquo;ol recursion, let&amp;rsquo;s refresh our understanding using the iconic factorial program.
$$0! = 1$$
$$n! = n (n-1)!$$
Python Implementation:
1 2 3 4 5 def fact(x): if (x==0): return 1 else: return x * fact(x-1) But python is just too mainstream and overrated, let&amp;rsquo;s use Lisp!</description><dc:creator>Yusuf Hegazy</dc:creator><media:content url="https://hegzploit.github.ioimages/header/recursion_header.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
