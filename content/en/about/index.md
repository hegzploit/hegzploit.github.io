# tl;dr,
I'm an Electrical Engineer by day, Computer Hacker by night. sometimes my hacker side prevails and I'm hacking full shift, That's how I usually drop in GPA. This is my hacker blog where I share my work, also a place where I post my thoughts, both in english and arabic.

# ✨ Interests ✨
I usually say I love computers, It's a really broad thing to say so I will try to go a bit deeper into what exactly I love about computers.
### 1. from the ground up 🧱
From holes printed on cards programmed in fortran to vaccum tubes that are huge and crazy to transistors then MOSFETs, I love the history and progress we have made in computers, I'm saddened that I didn't get to witness It too, I was just born after the DOS era, this doesn't stop me from going full-caveman mode and learning 80's tech though.

It's not all about retro computing, the hacking scene back in the day was also way more exciting, people could learn all it is to know about binary exploits in a weekend, stuff was way more approachable back then and we had amazing e-zines like phrack where a lot of [cool stuff](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html) was born.

### 2. binex 🔧
Binary exploits are another thing I love, I thought I would dedicate this section to talking more about them, I have already mentioned my love for low-level computing so It's only natural that I would love low-level computer security stuff, famously known as *Binary Exploitation*, sometimes It falls under the domains of *Systems Security* for the layman out there.

I don't claim to be a master exploit developer, I'm still in my journey to be one, I'm pursuing my yellow belt in [pwn.college 🥋](https://dojo.pwn.college/hackers/1570) though I have slowed down a bit for the sake of my GPA.

### 3. programming paradigms 🎨
I think programming is an art, and I love all the different styles of it, I will rank my favorite paradigms and languages below.
1. Functional
    1. ML - OCaml
    2. Lisp - Scheme/Clojure
2. Descriptive
    1. Prolog
    2. Coq
    3. HDL
3. Imperative/General Purpose
    1. C
    2. Python

{{< notice info "Note" >}}
I don't claim to be an expert at the above programming languages, I just respect their design and semantics.

### 4. content creation 🎞️
I find it enjoyable, and I believe Its an effecient way to [learn stuff properly](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+feynman+method+of+learning), that's why I have two youtube channels and this blog.

I use my [personal channel](https://youtube.com/@YusufHegazy) for anything I love to talk about and It's mostly stuff related to my studies, new tools I learn and general Interests.

My [hacking channel](https://youtube.com/@hegzploit) is exclusive cybersecurity stuff, mainly pwn.

# Tooling 🧰
I believe tools are very important in our trade, they not only help us get jobs done but also we get to form little cults and brag about how our choice is superior to others!

### 1. Vi/Vim
learning Vim bindings is by far one of the greatest investments I did myself, I find myself doing a lot of weird text manipulations using Vim Wizardy that I'm not sure how I could've done otherwise, It also makes me look cool in front of others.

### 2. Linux
Linux is another big one in my arsenal, I used to fret a lot about distros and have tried almost every mainstream distro but in the end, It doesn't matter a lot to me anymore, nowadays I onyl care about having a terminal ready, this is where most of my magic happens, regardless of the flavour of my Linux.

Here's a list of my boxes and their distros.
- Main PC: PopOS w/ Windows 11 Dualboot
- Main Laptop: MBP2012 with [arch](https://axyl-os.github.io/) (this is my "I use arch btw" pass)
- Old 2009 HP Laptop: Voidlinux, I use this box as a server mostly.

# Philosophies 🧠
I will talk a bit about some philosophies/principles that I love to follow.

### 1. It is no use crying over spilled milk 
> You can't tell Mommy what to do. You can't tell Daddy what to do. Everyone will just get mad.
> You can tell YOU what to do. Control yourself and everyone is happy!

Tame your emotions, become content with what you have, accept how things are and stop worrying about everything that is outside of your control. Now that you waste less time worrying you can focus on what matters.

### 2. LMGTFY[^1] 🔍
In this era, one can find anything he wants on the internet, so please just use google the next time you want answers, I'm not a genius "Mr. know it all", I just know how to use google better than you do.

### 3. Don't ask to ask ⁉️
---> https://dontasktoask.com

### 4. No Hello 👋

<a href="https://no-hello.com">
{{<img src="https://nohello.club/images/nohello_320_tr_w.png" width="200px" caption="Click Me" position="center">}}
</a>

### 5. The XY Problem
> The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.

# Education
The way our educational system is built, It discourages any innovation and binds students to follow one path to get their share of society, I despise it and I will leave it at that, I can do nothing about it, I just gotta deal with it, this is why I try to balance between my boring academic life and the other things I do, It's no easy feat. I might blog about this actually.

# Normie Me
I also do other non-computer stuff, here I will talk about It.

### 1. Anime 🌸
I watch a lot of anime, I could rank my top stuff here but I have an updated list over at [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/hegzploit?status=7&order=4&order2=0)

### 2. Cooking 🥧🤌
I enjoy cooking a lot, I mostly make dessert and sweet stuff, a cooking section is a WIP here, for now have a picture of my cheesecake.
{{<img src="/images/whoami/cheesecake.jpg" width="400px" caption="First classic cheesecake I made." position="center">}}

### 3. Gaming 👾
I'm not that big into gaming, I get bored really fast with most games, only two games have stuck with me: League of Legends (I know, I'm not proud of that one) and Minecraft.

I'm usually down for trying new games, thought I hate games that require a lot of commitment, I already have a lot of things that waste my time than games so I would rather not add one more thing to the list.

I love retro MMORPGs like [RPG MO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/372800/RPG_MO/), I have also discovered [Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/) and insta-bought [Shenzhen I/O](https://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/), It's an amazing programming game and I'm looking forward to trying more of their games soon.
