# tl;dr,
My real name is Yusuf Hegazy, I graduated from the faculty of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering Depratment, Egyptian Academy for Engineering and Advanced Technology in 2023.

I'm an Aspiring Vulnerability Researcher based in Egypt, I currently work as a Security Engineer at CyberDefeders with some of the greatest minds I have ever met.

As for my hobbies, I enjoy tinkering with electronics and hardware stuff, I also play CTFs with a main focus on pwn and reverse engineering, and sometimes I do programming for fun.
