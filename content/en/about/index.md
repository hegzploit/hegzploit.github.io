# tl;dr,
My real name is Yusuf Hegazy. I graduated in 2023 from the Faculty of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering Department.

I have two years of experience in the cybersecurity industry. I began my career as a penetration tester at a local consultancy during my senior year of university. After completing my bachelor's degree, I transitioned into a role as a Product Engineer at CyberDefenders, a leading platform for blue team training and certification. Currently, I am a fulltime researcher pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, specializing in hardware security, with a focus on side-channel analysis and leakage modeling.

In my free time, I create technical content on YouTube in my native language and occasionally write blogs. I also enjoy tinkering with electronics and hardware and participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, with a focus on pwn and reverse engineering challenges. Occasionally, I write code purely for fun.
