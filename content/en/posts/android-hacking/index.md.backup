I have been doing some research into android security lately, and It was quite *different* than anything I have tried before, the eco system was more friendly than I imagined, a lot of frameworks and tooling was availiable. I will try to document some lessons learned from my little trip so that anyone (including future me) can learn.

## Initial Steps

Before starting any android application analysis, I love to start with a simple run of `APKiD` which is the android counterpart of the popular `PEiD`, It will scan all the classes and libraries of the android apk revealing the presence of any packer or obfuscator. It uses yara rules [under the hood](https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD/tree/master/apkid/rules).
