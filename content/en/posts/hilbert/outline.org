* Back to Euclid
** Solution of the parallel postulate in the 19th century
*** Euclid's 5 postulates
**** they all are intuitive except the 5th
***** maybe cuz it has to do with infinity?
**** can we deduce the 5th from the first 4 axioms?
***** upon inverting the parallel postulate we get valid new geometry! (hyperbolic)
***** so it's impossible to prove the fifth postualte
***** meme
* Reasons for axiomatizing geometry
** Intuition is elastic faculty (https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=WgwUCgAAQBAJ)
** We need more solid ground to base upon our systems
** Not a safe guide that can be used to asses the truthfulness of science.
** since a lot of people started questioning euclidean geometry, something had to be done

* Hilbert's goal
** he wanted to avoid intuition when reasoning about geometry
** abstract
** One must be able to say at all times – instead of points, straight lines, and planes – tables, chairs and beer mugs.
