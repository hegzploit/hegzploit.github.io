A lot of people are driven by emotions, logical thinking doesn't always result in agreement, in fact, most people are more influenced by emotions than logic, does that make logical thinking uselss.

It depends on a lot of factors, you shouldn't boldly assume that logic works with everyone, a good strategy to get your message through might be analyzing the recipient, before deciding on your means of communication.

That's a useful skill If you have to deal with multitude of different people, life is all about balancing things and overdoing is never wise.
